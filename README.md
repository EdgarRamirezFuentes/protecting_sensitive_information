## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>

The CEO of certain company is promoting less use of paper. He wishes that sensitive
documents be digital. Thus, this documents usually are signed by the board of directors
(group of people that take decisions in the company). Also only the board of directors 
can see the content of these sensitive documents. They do not want to share a unique key,
i.e. every member of the board must have her/his own key or keys. Imagine that your
team is hired to develop a solution for this company.
